                Our software is currently ROS (1) based. If you're familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, you'll find
                comfort in knowing that our software is very full of abstractions. This means that adding
                features is really easy but learning all the classes and layers will take time, but it will be
                worth it. If nothing else, it will show you the power of OOP.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, where do you get started? Unfortunately, the learning curve on this is pretty steep
                and to be honest I'm probably not in a position to be giving advice. Nonetheless, I'd like to
                share my experience with ROS in hopes it will guide beginners.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think I should say
                this upfront: developing software for the lab is a commitment. It's a commitment to <b>ROS</b>,
                to <b>C++</b>, to <b>Python</b> (maybe), <b>CMAKE</b>, <b>Linux</b>, and <b>Git</b>.
                Luckily, almost all - if not all - of these tools are used in other robotics labs, so it's
                a worthwhile commitment.

                    Before you begin developing, you need to feel comfortable moving through
                    a UNIX-based filesystem. If you want a full tutorial,
                    <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php">this</a>
                    is the one I used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These commands are your bread and butter:
                    <ul>
                      <li> <font size="3px"><code>cd</code></font> <i>[dir]</i> - change directory </li>
                      <li> <font size="3px"><code>ls</code></font> <i>[dir]</i> - print directory contents </li>
                    </ul>
                    Congrats! Now you know how to navigate through a UNIX filesystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You should also know a little about how commands are run in the terminal. Commands
                    are convenient ways for a user to run a script or executable that isn't necessarily
                    in your current directory. If you type the command:
                    <font size="3"><tt><code>$env</code></tt></font> (without the $), you'll see a bunch of variables
                    set equal to lists of directories in your filesystem. The <i>PATH</i> variable is of particular
                    interest since this is where your shell (running terminal) looks to execute your commands. Keep
                    this in mind when you're navigating through and using your terminal.

                  If you're like me, you need to know exactly what you're doing when you do something. This was a huge
                  problem for me when I ran into CMake, which is the make tool that ROS uses to build packages. The file
                  can be especially confusing if you've never seen a makefile... or really even if you <i>have</i> seen
                  one. The tool aims to make software packages compatible across any platform (platform can refer to
                  Operating System, build tools, package version, etc. - anything that might affect how you compile/link/run
                  your code). This is a pretty big deal
                  for developers since they won't have to worry too much about portability when writing their code. Or when
                  they do, it will be easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Put simply, a makefile like CMakeLists provides a way of compiling and linking (building your code's executables
                  so you can actually run it) without rebuilding things that don't need to be rebuilt. CMake also provides a
                  way for your compiler to find the source dependencies (#include'd headers, library files). It might not be easy to
                  see why you'd want this if you've only worked on projects with a couple of source files, but imagine that you had
                  written a project that contained hundreds of sources files (or even more).

                  Honestly, my favorite tool. Don't be afraid to look up your errors or questions on Google. I don't copy and paste
                  (anymore), but I still use a quick search to find out what others have done and if there are things already available
                  that might make my life easier - so really just a research tool. But for beginners, take the answers
                  with a grain of salt. It's always better to know what you're doing. After all, the stuff you write is going toward
                  a multi-million dollar machine. Better not to leave it to some random person with a keyboard.

                  As of when I'm writing this, Python 2 is being EOL'd and we haven't really heard anything from ROS about its future
                  support. So, we're moving towards C++ for everything we write. I don't have advice on learning a programming language
                  other than - you guessed it - doing it. But I will say this, do not let C++ be your first language. Just don't. Python
                  isn't too great either as a first unless you just want something done, and quickly.

                  Ahh... Git. You're gonna hate it at first since you'll be worried about messing things up, but it'll really grow
                  on you. Once you're accustomed to it, you'll want to put everything you've ever worked on inside a Git repository
                  - even something like, I don't know, a website *cough*.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Git is software for <b>version control</b>. Meaning, your code goes through several stages of continuous development and
                  you need a good way to organize this <i>history</i> of adding, removing, and changing. If only there was a way to keep
                  track of all your changes throughout development. Enter Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is said that 90% of the time spent writing code is spent editing it. And most of the time, you'll make changes that
                  you're not to sure about or don't want in the final product. Git allows for <b>branching</b> off the main development
                  history. This means that you can make changes that won't affect a working model that you might already have and can
                  test this new branch freely. Better yet, Git not only allows <i>you</i> to make these branches, but <i>any</i> number
                  of developers to do this in parallel. Imagine if there wasn't something like this - there might be something like a
                  crowd of software engineers at Google or Amazon clustered around the same keyboard trying to put their code in. There is
                  plenty of more features associated with Git, but it's really more of a learn-as-you-go type of tool. Ugh, I'm starting
                  to doubt if I'm really even helping. But truthfully, this tool is one that arises out of necessity, so it really only makes
                  sense that you learn it as you need it. And that will be often.

              So, the tutorials are great if you take your time with them. But, that's hard to do when
              you're more interested in actually <b>doing stuff</b> for the lab. Apparently, it's during
              this process that the lab loses a lot of potential software people. I found that the best
              way to learn this stuff is the same as the best way to learn everything else: doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, my advice is just to ask for a task and try your hand at it. There's going to be a
              lot of things you don't know how to do, but that's where having an actual task comes in.
              You'll end up looking up how to do a specific thing for that task (say, in ROS). You'll
              try copying and pasting some code you find on StackOverflow. If you're real lucky, this'll
              work. But, most of the time, it won't. Then, when you're done pulling your hair out, you'll
              realize that you need to learn the basics of what you're doing in order to be comfortable
              doing it. In the same way you can write an informative essay much easier if you did your
              research, you can write code better if you know what it means. This is pretty obvious, but
              I think a lot of programmers tend to forget this, so keep it in the back of your mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, you might end up back at the tutorials. But that's fine! Because now you have
              some context into why you're doing them. The entire time you're doing the tutorial now,
              you might be thinking about how you can adopt the information into your task - as opposed
              to wondering why any of it matters.
