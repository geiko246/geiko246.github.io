              If you're here, I most likely recommended you see this page to get started on learning lab stuff. Here's

                Our software is currently ROS (1) based. If you're familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, you'll find
                comfort in knowing that our software is very full of abstractions. This means that adding
                features is really easy but learning all the classes and layers will take time, but it will be
                worth it. If nothing else, it will show you the power of OOP.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, where do you get started? Unfortunately, the learning curve on this is pretty steep
                and to be honest I'm probably not in a position to be giving advice. Nonetheless, I'd like to
                share my experience with ROS in hopes it will guide beginners.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think I should say
                this upfront: developing software for the lab is a commitment. It's a commitment to <b>ROS</b>,
                to <b>C++</b>, to <b>Python</b> (maybe), <b>CMAKE</b>, <b>Linux</b>, and <b>Git</b>.
                Luckily, almost all - if not all - of these tools are used in other robotics labs, so it's
                a worthwhile commitment.

            <h3>The Tutorials</h3>

              So, the tutorials are great if you take your time with them. But, that's hard to do when
              you're more interested in actually <b>doing stuff</b> for the lab. Apparently, it's during
              this process that the lab loses a lot of potential software people. I found that the best
              way to learn this stuff is the same as the best way to learn everything else: doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, my advice is just to ask for a task and try your hand at it. There's going to be a
              lot of things you don't know how to do, but that's where having an actual task comes in.
              You'll end up looking up how to do a specific thing for that task (say, in ROS). You'll
              try copying and pasting some code you find on StackOverflow. If you're real lucky, this'll
              work. But, most of the time, it won't. Then, when you're done pulling your hair out, you'll
              realize that you need to learn the basics of what you're doing in order to be comfortable
              doing it. In the same way you can write an informative essay much easier if you did your
              research, you can write code better if you know what it means. This is pretty obvious, but
              I think a lot of programmers tend to forget this, so keep it in the back of your mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, you might end up back at the tutorials. But that's fine! Because now you have
              some context into why you're doing them. The entire time you're doing the tutorial now,
              you might be thinking about how you can adopt the information into your task - as opposed
              to wondering why any of it matters.
